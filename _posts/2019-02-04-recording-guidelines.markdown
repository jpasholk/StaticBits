Thank you for thinking about recording with us! 

We're delighted at the thought of chatting about the JAMstack, and Web Development in general. 

In this post, we'll go over everything you might need to know about recording an episode to get you up to speed before we start. 

If you have some ideas about what you'd like to chat about, please let us know ahead of time so we can add them to the show notes. We'll send them to you before recording so you can prepare a bit.

## Recording the Episode

It generally takes about 15-30 minutes to get organized before an episode; it can be a few minutes to get acquainted and comfortable.

To help with the sound quality of your episode, here are some things to think about:

* We record locally, and then sync everything up afterward in post-production.

* You will be recording your voice with a decent mic and headphones, on your computer and then sending it to us after.

* To sync up the audio, we use a clap; this means that everyone besides the host takes off their headphones and places them as close to the mic as possible (after pressing record, of course), then the host claps three times. The clap should register on the audio tracks of everyone and makes it easier to sync in post-production.

* If you don’t already prefer audio recording software, we recommend [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - it’s open source, cross-platform and meets our needs nicely as long as you can send us a wave file, preferably archived.

* During recording, try and be as still as possible, please try not to fidget or move around too much. It’s insane what a microphone will pick up, and it’s super hard to edit this stuff out in post-production.

* Give more room then you’d think for people to talk. In ordinary conversation people tend to talk over each other or begin speaking right after someone stops, this is difficult to make sound natural in post-production and can add more work on our editors before publishing your episode. Try to give people a few seconds after they stop speaking before you start.

* By far the most difficult one for the majority of people is to avoid your ‘Um’s and Uuuhh’s… It’s not that difficult to edit them out, but it does add to the work. When in doubt, silence is best.
