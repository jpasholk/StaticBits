We were able to have a nice chat with Phil Hawksworth in our third episode. After introducing himself and talking a bit about coming to work for Netlify, Phil then answers some questions about the JAMstack, Netlify, The JAMstack Conference, and more. 

He also reveals that he is indeed a Super Villan that lives under a volcano with submarine access, complete with a spectacular British accent.
